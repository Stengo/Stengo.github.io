For this project, a few things came together: First, I needed a keystroke visualizer for pair programming and couldn't find one I liked. Second, I was looking for an excuse to get more familiar with macOS development, as my day job revolved exclusively around iOS. And third, I wanted to create my first open-source project.

[The result](https://github.com/Stengo/Exposition) was a fairly simple tool that accomplished all of the original goals. I never spent any time promoting it, so it lives in obscurity, but it seems like at least a handful of people stumbled across it and found it useful.
