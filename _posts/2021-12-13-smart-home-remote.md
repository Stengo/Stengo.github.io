After seeing the Apple AirTag's precise location features, enabled by ultra-wideband, I thought back to
[Sevenhugs' beautiful, but ultimately doomed, smart home remote](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/11/10/13583002/sevenhugs-smart-remote-control-price)
that adapted its interface to whichever device it was pointed at.

Inspired by the promise that the same kind of interaction might be possible using hardware that people were already carrying around (rather than a $300 single-purpose remote) I procured a UWB development board and implemented a working prototype in around 2 weeks.

The accompanying video I shot gathered a decent amount of attention from sites like [9to5Mac](https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/13/homekit-u1-precision-iphone-control/), [Gizmodo](https://gizmodo.com/an-ios-developer-just-created-the-effortless-smart-home-1848205286) and [The Mac Observer](https://www.macobserver.com/news/homekit-and-u1-chip-should-be-a-no-brainer/), as well as a number of companies and people. It even led to my being interviewed by a reporter from [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-end-of-car-keys-passwords-and-fumbling-with-your-phone-at-checkout-11641618007).

But among my favorite responses was that of a group of students from Duke University who were eager to turn the concept into a product. I gave them access to my codebase, and we stayed in regular contact. When they launched their [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/905353513/fluid-one-next-generation-smart-home-control-and-automation), I agreed to be mentioned as a technical advisor.

And while that project was ultimately unsuccessful, it did manage to achieve a secret goal I had had for years: getting my name mentioned on [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/17/23308680/fluid-one-apple-iphone-uwb-smart-home-system).
