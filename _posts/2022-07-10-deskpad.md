My second foray into creating open source projects was brought on by the sudden rise of remote work during the COVID-19 lockdowns.

While I was using an ultrawide monitor, many of my colleagues preferred to work on their laptop screens. During pair programming, this resulted in them being barely able to decipher what was happening on my end. Initially, I counteracted this by switching to a 1080p/16:9 resolution, but this meant I had to give up on screen real estate and visual fidelity.

Since I had had some experience writing macOS apps with [Exposition](https://github.com/Stengo/Exposition), I figured I might be able to write a program that creates a virtual monitor and projects it onto an application window. That way, I could still share the entire virtual screen, while retaining all of the benefits of my ultrawide monitor.

The final outcome, named [DeskPad](https://github.com/Stengo/DeskPad), not only solved my problem but also managed to find a grateful audience and even contributors.
