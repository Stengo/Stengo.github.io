![GitUp Image Diffing](\public\gitup.jpg){: .image-right }
I was originally introduced to GitUp by my former mentor, [Nils Becker](https://github.com/bckr), and immediately fell in love with the simple design and blazing fast performance.

The one thing I was missing about it was the ability to compare images on the fly. As we were doing a lot of snapshot testing of views at my day job, this was a crucial feature.

Luckily, GitUp is an open-source project, so I went ahead and got to implementing a version of image diffing that was heavily inspired by my favorite image comparison mode on GitHub.

After opening the [pull request](https://github.com/git-up/GitUp/pull/748) I decided to record an explainer of my particular approach to implementing the feature, as I figured it might be interesting to someone else and I was looking for an excuse to learn more about video production.

While the [resulting video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl-oT3dM6QQ) never ended up gathering any kind of audience, I am still quite happy with it.
