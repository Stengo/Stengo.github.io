During my studies at [RWTH Aachen](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/), I tried to focus as much as possible on machine learning topics, as I was deeply interested in cognitive science and artificial intelligence.

This culminated in my bachelor thesis, in which I designed a program that allowed humans to aid machine learning algorithms in creating efficient and highly performant agents by easily choosing relevant training data.

While the work was not groundbreaking, it allowed me to dive deeper into the material, especially with respect to the usage of real-world libraries and tools. It also gave me my first proper experience designing a novel user interface.

A shortened version of my paper was later [published](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stefan-Schiffer-2/publication/314003629_Assisted_Feature_Engineering_and_Feature_Learning_to_Build_Knowledge-Based_Agents_for_Arcade_Games/links/58b154cea6fdcc6f03f68c2e/Assisted-Feature-Engineering-and-Feature-Learning-to-Build-Knowledge-Based-Agents-for-Arcade-Games.pdf) as part of the International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence (ICAART 2017).
