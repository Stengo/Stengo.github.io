I was never able to find a weather app I really loved. My main issue with almost all of them was that they offered an immense amount of depth but failed to give me the information I actually cared about at a glance.

When I started playing around with my own visualization, I was struck by how mountainlike the graphs for real-world weather data looked, and thus the idea of embedding them in a diorama depicting the current weather condition was born.

I tweaked this app over several years, adding many minor flourishes and effects, before releasing it to the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/overlook-weather/id1639571738).

It ended up getting some great reception on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/xtktxd/i_made_an_app_that_visualizes_weather_instead_of/), followed by coverage from [9to5Mac](https://9to5mac.com/2022/10/07/overlook-weather-beautiful-ui-and-free/) and a few other news sites. That attention momentarily catapulted it up the app store ranking, peaking at #2 in the US and #1 in Germany.

Despite putting an immense amount of effort into making the main visualization as beautiful as possible, my favorite and most-used part of the app was added at the very end of development and took less than a day. The memorable, glanceable design of the graphs allowed me to create a highly abstracted lock screen widget that arguably surpassed the core app in achieving my original goal.
